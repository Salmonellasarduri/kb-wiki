> **An Obsidian vault that makes Claude Code remember everything.** Start a session, talk about your day, and Claude handles the rest — notes, links, indexes, performance tracking. Every conversation builds on the last.

## 🔴 The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but it forgets. Every session starts from zero — no context on your goals, your team, your patterns, your wins. You re-explain the same things. You lose decisions made three conversations ago. The knowledge never compounds.

## 🟢 The Solution

Give Claude a brain.

```
You: "start session"
Claude: *reads North Star, checks active projects, scans recent memories*
Claude: "You're working on Project Alpha, blocked on the BE contract.
         Last session you decided to split the coordinator. Your 1:1
         with your manager is tomorrow — review brief is ready."
```

---

## ⚡ See It In Action

**Morning kickoff:**

```bash
/standup
# → loads North Star, active projects, open tasks, recent git changes
# → "You have 2 active projects. The auth refactor is blocked on API contract.
#    Your 1:1 with Sarah is at 2pm — last time she flagged observability."
```

**Brain dump after a meeting:**

```bash
/dump Just had a 1:1 with Sarah. She's happy with the auth work but wants
us to add error monitoring before release. Also, Tom mentioned the cache
migration is deferred to Q2 — we decided to focus on the API contract first.
Decision: defer Redis migration. Win: Sarah praised the auth architecture.
```

```
→ Updated org/people/Sarah Chen.md with meeting context
→ Created work/1-1/Sarah 2026-03-26.md with key takeaways
→ Created Decision Record: "Defer Redis migration to Q2"
→ Added to perf/Brag Doc.md: "Auth architecture praised by manager"
→ Updated work/active/Auth Refactor.md with error monitoring task
```

**Incident response:**

```bash
/incident-capture https://slack.com/archives/C0INCIDENT/p123456
# → slack-archaeologist reads every message, thread, and profile
# → people-profiler creates notes for new people involved
# → Full timeline, root cause analysis, brag doc entry
```

**End of day:**

```
You: "wrap up"
# → verifies all notes have links
# → updates indexes
# → brag-spotter finds uncaptured wins
# → suggests improvements
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

**Folders group by purpose. Links group by meaning.** A note lives in one folder (its home) but links to many notes (its context). Claude maintains this graph — linking work notes to people, decisions, and competencies automatically. When review season arrives, the backlinks on each competency note are already the evidence trail. A note without l
